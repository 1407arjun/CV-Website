                <p class="about-text">     
                    I am a computer science engineering student at 
                    Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. As a 
                    teenager at school, I was the kid other students 
                    approached about issues with their phone or laptop. 
                    I was the go-to guy for fixing resolving any technical 
                    problems. I love developing new things, especially apps.

                <p class="about-text">
                    Something that I love about programming is the opportunity 
                    to work with people from a wide range of disciplines. 
                    Being a student developer involves working with so many other 
                    students and departments and, as a person and someone who loves 
                    to build new relationships, itâ€™s great to be able to come together 
                    with other professionals who are striving towards the same goal.
